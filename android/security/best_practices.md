# [App Security Best Practices](https://developer.android.google.cn/topic/security/best-practices#java)

## Enforce secure communication

### Use implicit intents and non-exported content providers

+ **Show an app chooser**. If at least two apps on device can recive the implicit intent, show app choose can allows users to transfer sensitive information to an trust app;
+ If you want show data between two apps which controled an own by us, **apply signature-based permissions**;
+ Disallow access to your app's content providers;
  > Before Android 4.1.1, the `android:exported` attribute of the `<provider>` is ture by default.

### Apply network security meatures

+ Use SSL traffic;
+ For new or custom CA, add network security configuration;
  > During the development process, use the `<debug-overrides>` element to expliticly allow user-install certificates.  
+ Create your own trust manager. Set up trust manager and handle ssl warning, if occur one of the three conditions:
  1. you use the webserver that has certificate signed by a new or custom CA.
  2. That CA is not trusted by your device.
  3. You cannot use a network security configuration.

### Use WebView objects carefully

You should **never** enable JavaScript interface support unless you completely control and trust the content in your app's WebView objects.

+ Use HTML message channels
  > For android 6.0 (API level 23) and higher, use HTML message channels instead of `evaluateJavascript()` to communicate between a website and your app.

## Provide the right permission

Minimun number of permission necessary to function should be request and app should relinquish permission when they'er no longer needed.

### Use intents to defer permissions

e.g. Instead of ask `READ_CONTACT` and `WRITE_CONTACT` permissions, we use intent to direct users to a contact app
  
### Share data securely across apps
  
+ Enfore read-only or write-only permission as need.
+ Using the FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION and FLAG_GRANT_WRITE_URI_PERMISSION flags to provide one-time access to data.
+ When sharing data, use "content://" URI, not "file://" URI.

## Store data safely

### Private data should be store within internal storage

### Use external storage cautiously

+ Use scoped directory access.
+ Chech validity of data.
+ Store only non-sencitive data in cache files.
  > For cache large then 1M in size, should use `getExternalCacheDir()`; Otherwise, use `getCacheDir()` storeage.
+ Use SharedPreferences in private mode

## Keep services and dependencies up-to-date
